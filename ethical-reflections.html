<h1> <em> welcome to my ethical reflection</em></h1>
<p> <strong>I will discuss current issues, and give my take on them</strong> </p>
<p> The scale used to determine whether convicts are more likely to commit a crime is said to have some racial bias. I believe otherwise, thinking that the system was created for the sole purpose of predicting whether a convict was likely to commit another crime. There are several questions asked on this test such as “Has your family member ever been incarcerated?” and “Do you have a job?” I believe questions like these are valid. If a family member has been to jail, even though you are not the same as your family, you learn from the ones around you and could possibly make the same mistakes. Having a job is also an important piece, as this responsibility makes it less likely for someone to commit a crime because they are already preoccupied. Jobs provide people with money, and people are less likely to jeopardize their money to commit careless crimes. The system also never asked about a convict’s race. Questions might have similar answers from people of the same background, but I believe the system asked valid and important questions that keep our community safe. However, I do not believe the the courts should use this scale as a sentencing tool. This scale is a good thing to keep in mind when sentencing, but it should not have a great impact on the sentencing of the crime. After all, convicts go to jail based on a crime they have committed, not whether they will commit another crime in the future. </p>
