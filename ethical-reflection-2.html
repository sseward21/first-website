<h3> Algorithms in Everyday Social Media </h3>
<p> Algorithms also knowns as bots are used in everyday social media to detect and to uncover truth about viewers. Big companies such as facebook and google use data sold to them by other companies such as financial records to determine who is more likely or less likely to give into certain ads. This type of technology is far ahead of any minds of computer scientist and would not be possible without the advanced technology we have today. Algorithms give viewers ads based on their age,gender, financial status, and what they have previously liked before. The information can be gather based on people who have similar characteristics and watch histories on social media, but also but from companies with large amounts of information. Personally I feel that more Americans should be notified when their information is being used for certain types of testing. All americans deserve to know that when they sign into a website that their information could possibly be sold to other companies for research. This way we are able to make a choice. The problem with this type of system that traces your frequent searches and like is that we will soon end up in an endless spider web of ads and new videos suggested for us. Before we know it our screens will be covered with ads designed to get us to click on them. Computers and software companies already have so much information on us and computers are already getting smarter. Algorithms can already detect a person's sexual orientation based on their profile picture. More and more of our information is being put out making it more and more unsafe for citizens on the internet. Hackers also pose a problem for our citizens. Facebook and other corporation hold a ton of information about its users and hackers who access that data could use that information illegal purposes. Overall the use of algorithms can be dangerous and harmful to the american people and I feel this topic should be discussed more.
