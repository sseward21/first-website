<h1> <em> welcome to my ethical reflection</em></h1>
<p> <strong>dNet Neutrality
Net neutrality is the principle that internet servers provide the use of the internet equally to users, web browsers, and other companies online. Net Neutrality insures that all users and producers are not charged to use and access websites and databases. This process is all controlled by the internet servers. Internet servers make more money by removing net neutrality internet servers will end up making more money by charging to use a certain amount of websites. I personally believe this is not good for Americans. The things put on the internet are for us to see and use at our leisure. By taking away net neutrality many people and writers will not be able to share their work freely with a diverse audience to look at it. A certain group of people will be able to use these types of websites making the websites content more one sided and giving the procedures less diverse feedback. I believe net neutrality is a value of freedom we have in america. To be able to share and post on the internet is something we have recently developed and has been useful to the upcoming generation. Charging to use these outlets will decrease the use of these spaces but also decrease our knowledge of current events. Many people use social media as an outlet for new and other popular events. Without net neutrality protecting these elements many people will not be educated in the current news. Students in college and high school will also struggle. If parents refuse to pay for net neutrality our way of learning will completely be shifted. In the classroom we use internet a lot. Without it teacher will have to reframe their classwork and start to shift their class style. Lastly internet is used for research of kids of all years. Withoigh internet our whole research way of doing will be changed and ulters and ultimately made harder.
